# MARS-Splinter-BeautifulSoup-Challenge

## Utilize BeautifulSoup, a python package to web scrape data about Mars's enviornment and atmospheric conditions.

### Once data is scraped using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, it can be transformed into python lists, and subsequent pandas dataframes for analysis. Further transformation is required by converting columns values into the correct data type to have analysis perfomred on them if need be. 

## Results

### Figure one describes the minimum temperature of the differnt months of a year on Mars. It appears that the coldest months are what we concider in Wisconsin to be the end of winter, months 3, and 4. 

# Figure Two

### Figure two shows that the atmospheric pressure, unlike the minimum temperature, is highest in the later part of the year, in months 9 and 10. however, month 2 is the second highest in atmospheric pressure, and month 3 fourth, so there may be some indication of extreme weather patterns thorought the year on Mars.

# Figure Three

### Figure three is used to determine the length of a year on Mars via the peaks represented in this graph as the coldest time of year. From this analysis showing the peak minimum temperatures being month 3, and the warmest in moth 8, we can estimate a terrestrial day equivalancy to Mars being roughly 370 days.
